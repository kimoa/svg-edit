We could organize a one-day SVG-edit community event just before one of these conferences:

  * [The Graphical Web](http://graphicalweb.org/) (previously known as SVG Open)
    * [blog post about the 2012 edition and links to some videos](http://www.adrianparr.com/?p=389)
  * [Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM) in April 2013 in Madrid](http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2013/)


Any other related conferences?
